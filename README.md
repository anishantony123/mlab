## Use of blockchain

### 1. For verifying the members

Once the user signup (labourer or contractor) into the application then in the backend the super admin will create a ethereum account for him  Also the super admin will create a verification token (by using smart contract) for him and keep it in the system. This verification token ease the verification of user in future.


### 2. Gurentee the job

When the labour doing a job request and the contractor accept that request, the system will generate request and approval token  via smart contract and keeps the labour request token in contractor account and contract approval token in labourer account. This will ensure the gurentee for that particular contract(job) from both sides.

## Additional Features

### 1. Can able to apply rule for each contract
For a contractor while creating the contract he can able to add rules like

- Any language preference for labour.
- Need to add bid system in the contract.
- Any special skills are prefered... etc

### 2. Mobile application for labours
We created the labour portal as a mobile application for ease of use.

Also we provide the selection of native language in the application. which result labour can access the application in his on native language.
